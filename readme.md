## What is this?

It takes formatted notes and turns them into a spreadsheet. It uses indentations and asterisks in a text file to format. Exporting a google doc as a .txt file will turn bullet points into asterisks and is generally how I understood this would be used

## How do I run it?

Install [node](https://nodejs.dev/) on your machine.

Run `npm install` in the directory you have cloned this repository to (only needed once)

After these steps all you will need to do moving forwards is `node [path to script.js] [path to notes.txt file]` 

## Is there a license?

Use this however you want, but there are (generally open-source-type) licenses on packages used within this script
